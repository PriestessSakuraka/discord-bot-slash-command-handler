# discord-bot-slash-command-handler
discord.js, slash command handler, event handler...

##Usage
use "npm init" to create node_modules
then, use "npm install discord.js"
last thing you have to do is write your bot's id in settings.json and bot's token in token.json.
finally set up will be done.

##Notes
in SlashCommandsManager.js, there is addSelectMenuHandler method, but i don't think it's working, because i've never used it, even though i wrote it haha
